# Security Policy
The following policy provides a guide to handling secutity issues related to a GitHub repository including:

1. Addressing problems you find in the code
2. Issues raised by GitHub Security Advisory features
3. Modifying the Brakeman ignore file 

This document should be used in conjunction with wider information security policies and strandards as documented in the OMF document portal. 


## For tasks that require security sign-offs
Some tasks may require sign-off by the security team. The prime example of this is modifying the ignore file for Brakeman, to exclude certain alerts.

In these scenarios the following steps should be taken:

1. Add a requires-security-signoff to the Pull Request (PR)
2. Add a member of the security team to the PR to review
3. Incorporate any feedback from the security team  


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you spot a vulnerability in the source code and/or GitHub generates a security advisory the following process should be followed:

1. Create a backlog item in your project management tool e.g. Pivotal Tracker, Jira or Trello depending on what your team uses
2. Assess whether this can be worked on/assigned to another team member and the urgency
3. If this is low priority or requires effort spread out over several sprints, add to the backlog so it can be prioritized
